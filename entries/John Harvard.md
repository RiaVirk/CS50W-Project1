# John Harvard

**John Harvard** (1607-1638) was an English dissenting minister in Colonial America whose deathbed[2] bequest to the "schoale or colledge" founded two years earlier by the Massachusetts Bay Colony was so gratefully received that it was consequently ordered "that the Colledge agreed upon formerly to be built at Cambridge shalbee called Harvard Colledge."
**Death**
On 14 September 1638, Harvard died of tuberculosis and was buried at Charlestown's Phipps Street Burying Ground. In 1828, Harvard University alumni erected a granite monument to his memory there,[6][20] his original stone having disappeared during the American Revolution.[11]
Harvard's widow, Ann, is thought to have married Thomas Allen, his successor as the teacher of the Charlestown church. Allen acted as administrator in the execution of Harvard's estate and paid his bequests.[21]
